# Easy Life Inc
Don't mind the name, it was choosed by GitHub, but this is not the game's name.
This name too is temporary, that's why I don't change the repos name.

This is a new game by Guigui220D about robots taking over the world.

After the two version of Buildoland, I didn't want to stop and decided to make a new game with the knowledge I got from my past projects.
The game will be topdown-view, but not (or just not visibly) tile-based, will not be based on construction, and there won't be any multiplayer mode.
BUT, this time I want to make an actual game and not just an engine, and there will be a story, fights and choices to make.

This project won't be public until it actually looks good.
