# Buildoland 3

After Buildoland 1, and Buildoland 2, games that were both discontinued for not really valid reasons, i'm doing Buildoland 3!

Buildoland is a 2D topdown view building game with an infinite world that can be played alone of in multiplayer!

Although I took a lot of inspiration from Minecraft, the goal is not to make a 2D minecraft.

This game will stay in a private repos until it's actually playable.

For unexplaiable reasons, the codename fo this game is Super Duper Octo Enigma.
