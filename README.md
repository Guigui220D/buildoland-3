# Buildoland 3

After Buildoland 1, and Buildoland 2, games that were both discontinued for not really valid reasons, i'm doing Buildoland 3!

Buildoland is a 2D topdown view building game with an infinite world that can be played alone or in multiplayer.

Although I took a lot of inspiration from Minecraft, the goal is not to make a 2D minecraft.
